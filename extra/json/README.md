# JSON Outputs

This directory contains JSON output files for consumption by ET.

Do not edit `contracts.json` or `tokens.json` directly. Instead, edit the CSV files in `../cw20/` and run `npm run contracts` or `npm run tokens`, respectively.

`named_accounts.json` and `projects.json`, may be edited directly.

Refer to the root `README` for more details.
